#MAARK Dev Code Exercise
#=============================
#We ask that you complete the following programming test so that we can evaluate your development skills and methodologies.
#Objective:
#Develop the classic game Connect Four (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four). The app should allow two users to play. Users can be hard coded (no need to develop a sign up & login). User 1 should access their board at /games/1 and player two should access his board at /games/2. Each time the user makes a move, only the relevant portion of the page should be refreshed.
#Instructions:
#* Please do not take more than 5 hours to accomplish this task.
#* You do not need to fully complete the challenge. We will evaluate the code and time spent working on the problem.
#* You may use any third party JavaScript framework or library for front-end. Similarly, for backend and database, you can use the tech/frameworks of your choice.
 
#* You can decide whether or not to utilize algorithms on the web for core game logic. If you do, simply credit the URL in your code comments for reference.
#* We do not expect to see perfect code. What we want to see is how well you handle yourself given the time you spend on the problem, how you think, and how you prioritize when time is insufficient to solve the problem.
#* Please zip up the source project and send to us or place your code in a public Github repo so we can review it.
#* Optional: time permitting, you may wish to consider deploying to the hosting platform of your choice (heroku, AWS, Digital Ocean, etc.) and send us the url so that we may see the app in action.
